I really enjoy using the VI editor because it is difficult to accidentally delete the content of the folders and easier to use the commands. When I needed to google how to count, the command was easier to read/understand for me. Overall, I found this editor to be more user friendly and easier to troubleshoot with Google.

Nano would be my second choice. I dislike how the text doesn't wrap and troubleshooting with Google is difficult because so many things are called Nano, finding the how-to guides online required a lot of diggine. Overall I had to use grep to count how many times 'Kuno' and 'Vishta' appeared because I really was unable to use Nano for that. I did find a "search" function, but that was too hard for me to keep track of manually and I couldn't figure out another way to do it. I did, however, enjoy the saving functions, and being able to save the file name without going through additional steps. 

Emacs was the most difficult editor for me to use. Maybe because it was the first one I tried this exercise with? But in general, it was not very intuitive for me and my computer kept on yelling at me as I entered incorrect commands. It was hard for me to find my place, and easy for me to click around and mess up the content in the files. For someone like me who clicks the mouse way too much, Emacs was painful.
